    "The foundation of your project will be to collect appropriate data for the problem you are trying to solve. There is incredible versatility in how you can use an machine learning model. Some examples might be to predict the next social media trend, categorizing cancer cells, trying to better understand the relationship between temperature fluctuations and coffee bean growth rates, or creating a chat bot.\n",

    "Since we are very early in this course, and - most likely at this point - have not discussed many models, it may be difficult to know what you can do with a dataset, or what is in scope of this course.
